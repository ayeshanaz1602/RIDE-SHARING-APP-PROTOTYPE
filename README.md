Ride-Sharing App Prototype
A simple and functional ride-sharing app prototype that demonstrates core features such as real-time location tracking, ride request creation, and driver detail viewing. Built with the Google Maps SDK for map functionalities and Firebase Realtime Database for backend support, this app serves as a solid foundation for developing a full-scale ride-hailing platform.

üì± Features
Live Location Tracking: View your current location on the map with real-time updates.
Ride Requesting: Send a ride request by specifying your current location as the pickup point.
Driver Information: Fetch and display driver details such as name, car model, and live location.
Google Maps Integration: Seamless integration with Google Maps for geolocation and UI.
Firebase Backend: Realtime data handling with Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database.

üîß Tech Stack
Frontend: Native Android (Java)
Backend: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication
Maps & Location: Google Maps SDK, FusedLocationProviderClient
Tools: Android SDK, VS Code, Firebase Console

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ride-sharing-prototype.git
cd ride-sharing-prototype
Firebase Setup:
Create a new project on Firebase Console.
Add your Android app package name.
Download google-services.json and place it in the app/ directory.
Google Maps API Key:
Go to Google Cloud Console.
Create an API key and enable Maps SDK for Android.
Add the API key to AndroidManifest.xml.
Build & Run the App:
Use an Android device/emulator with location services enabled.
Grant location permissions when prompted.
The map should render your live location.

üß™ Usage
Launch the app.
Your current location is shown on the map.
Tap a "Request Ride" button (to be implemented in UI) to create a ride request.
The app stores the ride request in Firebase with pickup coordinates and user ID.
Driver data (mocked in Firebase) can be fetched to simulate driver assignment and details.
